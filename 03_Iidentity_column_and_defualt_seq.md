# Iidentity column and_defuald_seqence_value
Here are two option to create PK

## Identity column

The identity column is very useful for the surrogate primary key column. 
When we insert a new row into the identity column, Oracle auto-generates and insert a sequential value into the column.
o define an identity column, you use the identity clause as shown below:
```sql
GENERATED [ ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT [ ON NULL ] ] AS IDENTITY [ ( identity_options ) ] 
```
for example 
```sql
CREATE TABLE identity_demo (
    id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    description VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO identity_demo(description) VALUES('This is a test');
```

But if we try to insert value into the id colomn:
```sql
INSERT INTO identity_demo
      (id, description)
VALUES(2, 'Identity column example with GENERATED ALWAYS will fail!');    
```
*SQL Error:* ORA-32795: cannot insert into a generated always identity column

### GENERATED options
* ```GENERATED ALWAYS``` - Oracle generates a value for the identity column. 
                           Attempt to insert a value into the identity column *will cause an error*.
* ```GENERATED BY DEFAULT```: -  Oracle generates a value for the identity column if you provide no value. 
                                 If you provide a value, Oracle will insert that value into the identity column. 
                                 For this option, *Oracle will issue an error if you insert a NULL* value into the identity column.
* ```GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL```: Oracle generates a value for the identity column if you provide a NULL value or no value at all.

### main options of usage
* ```START WITH initial_value``` - The default initial value is 1.
* ```INCREMENT BY internval_value ``` defines the interval between generated values. By default, the interval value is 1.
* ```CACHE``` -  defines a number of values that Oracle should generate beforehand to improve the performance. 
                 *We should use this option when We expect high number of inserts.*
                 
## Generating a Default Value from a SEQUENCE
Referencing a sequence as a column default value in a create table statement. New with database 12c.
So both the i

```sql
CREATE TABLE db_12c_style_identity 
(  
id               INTEGER  DEFAULT ON NULL db_id_test_seq.nextval PRIMARY KEY, 
another_column   VARCHAR2(30) 
)
```
